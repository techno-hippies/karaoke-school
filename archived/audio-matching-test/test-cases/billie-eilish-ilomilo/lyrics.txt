[00:06.97] Told you not to worry
[00:10.56] But maybe that's a lie
[00:14.85] Honey, what's your hurry?
[00:18.43] Won't you stay inside?
[00:22.85] Remember not to get too close to stars
[00:26.74] They're never gonna give you love like ours
[00:31.70] Where did you go?
[00:33.16] I should know, but it's cold
[00:35.38] And I don't wanna be lonely
[00:37.41] So show me the way home
[00:42.28] I can't lose another life
[00:48.05] Hurry, I'm worried
[00:54.61] The world's a little blurry
[00:58.73] Or maybe it's my eyes
[01:02.81] The friends I've had to bury
[01:06.58] They keep me up at night
[01:10.59] Said I couldn't love someone
[01:12.80] 'Cause I might break
[01:14.89] If you're gonna die, not by mistake
[01:19.22] So, where did you go?
[01:20.94] I should know, but it's cold
[01:23.28] And I don't wanna be lonely
[01:25.35] So tell me you'll come home
[01:30.34] Even if it's just a lie
[01:34.70] I tried not to upset you
[01:36.99] Let you, rescue, me the day I met you
[01:41.12] I just wanted to protect you
[01:46.68] But now I'll never get to
[01:52.25] Hurry, I'm worried
[02:00.45] 
[02:08.02] Where did you go?
[02:09.21] I should know, but it's cold
[02:11.13] And I don't wanna be lonely
[02:13.29] Was hoping you'd come home
[02:18.57] I don't care if it's a lie
[02:21.09]
