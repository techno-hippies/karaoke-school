[00:07.99] I think about it all the time
[00:10.78] That I might run out of time
[00:12.76] But I finally met my baby
[00:14.61] And a baby might be mine
[00:16.64] 'Cause maybe one day I might
[00:18.55] If I don't run out of time
[00:20.46] Would it give my life a new purpose? (Mm)
[00:23.39] I was walking around in Stockholm
[00:26.38] Seriously thinking 'bout my future for the first time
[00:30.50] It was ice-cold, playing demos on my iPhone
[00:34.39] I went to my friend's place, and I met their baby for the first time
[00:39.97] How sublime
[00:41.05] What a joy, oh my, oh my
[00:43.09] Standing there
[00:43.89] Same old clothes she wore before holding her child, yeah
[00:47.74] She's a radiant mother, and he's a beautiful father
[00:50.50] And now they both know these things that I don't
[00:55.37] I think about it all the time
[00:57.89] That I might run out of time
[00:59.98] But I finally met my baby
[01:01.99] And a baby might be mine
[01:03.84] 'Cause maybe one day I might
[01:05.81] If I don't run out of time
[01:07.81] Would it make me miss all my freedom?
[01:09.80] I think about it all the time
[01:11.12] I-I think about it all the time
[01:13.63] That I might run out of time
[01:15.61] But I finally met my baby
[01:17.54] And a baby might be mine
[01:19.56] 'Cause maybe one day I might
[01:21.51] If I don't run out of time
[01:23.53] Would it give my life a new purpose?
[01:25.42] I think about it all the time
[01:26.71] 
[01:41.75] And they're exactly the same, but they're different now
[01:45.73] And I'm so scared I'm missin' out on something
[01:49.76] So, we had a conversation on the way home
[01:52.50] Should I stop my birth control?
[01:54.29] 'Cause my career feels so small in the existential scheme of it all
[01:57.94] 
[02:12.65] I think about it all the time
[02:13.59]
