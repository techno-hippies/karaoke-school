[00:00.78] Two Augusts ago
[00:03.38] I told the truth, oh, but you didn't like it, you went home
[00:09.56] You're in your Benz, I'm by the gate
[00:17.55] Now you go alone
[00:19.70] Charm all the people you train for, you mean well but aim low
[00:25.95] And I'll make it known like I'm getting paid
[00:32.41] That's just the way life goes
[00:36.30] I like to slam doors closed
[00:40.65] Trust me, I know it's always about me
[00:47.52] I love you, I'm sorry
[00:50.62] Two summers from now
[00:52.95] We'll have been talking, but not all that often, we're cool now
[00:58.69] I'll be on a boat, you're on a plane
[01:04.34] Going somewhere, same
[01:07.49] And I'll have a drink
[01:09.64] Wistfully lean out my window and watch the sun set on the lake
[01:15.34] I might not feel real, but it's okay, mm
[01:21.79] 'Cause that's just the way life goes
[01:26.20] I push my luck, it shows
[01:30.35] Thankful you don't send someone to kill me
[01:37.05] I love you, I'm sorry
[01:39.32] You were the best, but you were the worst
[01:41.43] As sick as it sounds, I loved you first
[01:43.76] I was a dick, it is what it is
[01:45.56] A habit to kick, the age-old curse
[01:47.86] I tend to laugh whenever I'm sad
[01:49.91] I stare at the crash, it actually works
[01:51.96] Making amends, this shit never ends
[01:53.70] I'm wrong again, wrong again
[01:55.90] The way life goes
[01:59.16] Joyriding down our road
[02:03.08] Lay on the horn to prove that it haunts me
[02:10.37] I love you, I'm sorry
[02:12.43] The way life goes
[02:15.52] I wanna speak in code
[02:19.67] Hope that I don't, won't make it about me
[02:26.86] I love you, I'm sorry
[02:30.45]
