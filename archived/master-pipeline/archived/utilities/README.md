# Archived Utilities

These are one-time scripts that were used during development but are not part of the regular pipeline.

## Scripts

### update-artist-avatar.ts
Updates an existing Lens account's metadata to include avatar from Genius.
**Usage**: One-time fix for artists missing avatars.

### set-metadata-uri.ts
Sets Lens account metadata URI directly.
**Usage**: Manual metadata updates when needed.

## Why Archived?

These scripts are not part of the automated pipeline but may be useful for manual operations or debugging.
