/**
 * Segment From Middle (Offset Playback)
 *
 * This story demonstrates a critical feature: recording a segment that doesn't start
 * at the beginning of the song.
 *
 * **Why this matters:**
 * Most songs are split into segments like:
 * - Intro (0:00-0:30)
 * - Verse 1 (0:30-1:00)
 * - Chorus (1:00-1:30) ‚Üê User selects this
 * - Verse 2 (1:30-2:00)
 *
 * When the user selects "Chorus", we need to:
 * 1. Load the FULL instrumental track
 * 2. Seek to 1:00 (segmentStartTime)
 * 3. Start recording from that point
 * 4. Show lyrics that correspond to 1:00-1:30 in the song
 * 5. Auto-stop at 1:30 (segmentEndTime)
 *
 * **Technical details:**
 * - The audio element's currentTime is set to segmentStartTime
 * - Lyrics have absolute timings (not relative to segment)
 * - Recording captures only the 30-second segment
 *
 * **Use cases:**
 * - User selected "Chorus" segment (starts at 1:15)
 * - User selected "Bridge" segment (starts at 2:30)
 * - Any non-intro segment
