[00:07.51] Bottle in my hand, the whiskey up high
[00:11.44] Two hands to Heaven, wild horses run wild, oh
[00:17.92] God only knows why, though (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
[00:22.91] Rhinestones and diamonds both shine in the light
[00:26.96] Two hands to Heaven, my whiskey up high, oh (oh)
[00:32.97] God only, God only knows why though (oh, oh, oh)
[00:38.15] In the Arizona heat, summer fling saw your best side
[00:42.51] Slip into my dreams every night, be the good guy
[00:46.57] Who am I to judge, my baby? (Uh-uh)
[00:50.32] Who am I to love, my baby? (Uh-uh)
[00:54.09] Purple-colored mink, sugarcane hittin' them 16 switches
[00:58.03] Candy apple green candy paint, swirling 24-inch spinners (swirl)
[01:02.52] Don't judge me, baby (ha)
[01:05.37] You would never judge me, baby
[01:09.49] Bottle in my hand, my whiskey up high
[01:13.41] Two hands to Heaven, coyotes run wild, oh (oh, oh)
[01:19.41] God only, God only knows why, though (why? Why? Why?)
[01:24.92] Ten thousand steps towards the time of your life
[01:28.92] Two hands to Heaven, my whiskey up high, oh (oh)
[01:35.00] God only, God only knows why, though
[01:38.09] Why, though? Why, though?
[01:40.26] Two hands to Heaven I've prayed, priest forgive my soul
[01:44.36] Lovely daggers pierced my heart many moons ago
[01:48.34] Toxic roses chased by wolves and carnivores
[01:52.11] Lost virgins with broken wings that will regrow
[01:55.57] I'm a stallion runnin', no candle in the wind
[01:59.51] You won't ever see me comin' or goin', but you'll know whenever I'm here
[02:03.82] Dancin' in the moonlight, catchin' every breeze
[02:07.84] My feet on the dashboard, now go really fast, boy
[02:11.34] Ever since I went to Marfa, ain't no trouble on my mind (on my mind, on my mind)
[02:15.01] Singin' sweet songs to Las Vegas, singin', "I will carry on"
[02:19.15] Carry on, carry on, carry on, carry on
[02:24.78] Singin', "I will carry on"
[02:26.94] Ten thousand steps towards the time of your life
[02:30.76] Two hands to Heaven, my whiskey up high, oh (oh, oh)
[02:36.75] God only, God only knows why, though (why, though? Why?)
[02:42.50] Rhinestones and diamonds both shine in the light
[02:46.32] Two hands to Heaven, coyotes run wild, oh
[02:52.36] God only, God only knows why, though (God only, God only knows why, though)
[02:57.37] Two hands to Heaven I've prayed, priest forgive my soul
[03:01.85] Lovely daggers pierced my heart many moons ago
[03:05.76] Toxic roses chased by wolves and carnivores
[03:09.50] Lost virgins with broken wings that will regrow
[03:14.59] 
[03:20.27] Swirl

[04:52.85] And our bigger meaning
[04:54.65] So, let's lose us in these sheets, yeah (yeah)
[04:58.25] And when I get up to walk, I wanna feel weak, yeah
