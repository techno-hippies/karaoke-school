docker push t3333chn0000/bmi-service:v1.0.0

# Deploy to Akash
akash tx deployment create deploy-akash.yaml --from mykey
```

## Use Case: ISWC Discovery

BMI Songview is useful for finding ISWCs when you have:
- Song title + performer name
- Need to validate against MLC publisher data
- Cross-referencing with other PRO databases (ASCAP, SESAC)

The service returns comprehensive metadata that can be used for:
- Publisher verification
- Writer/composer identification
- Ownership share validation
- Cross-PRO reconciliation

## Notes

- BMI Songview doesn't support ISRC search (recordings)
- Returns first best match based on title/performer normalization
- Handles "BMI Award Winning Song" prefixes automatically
- Status indicates reconciliation state with other PROs
