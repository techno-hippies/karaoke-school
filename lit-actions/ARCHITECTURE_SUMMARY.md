# Lit Actions Architecture Summary

## üéØ Key Deliverables Completed

### 1. Critical Signature Pattern Documentation
- **File**: `docs/LENS_SIGNATURE_PATTERN.md`
- **Purpose**: Extensively documents the complex 16-field EIP-712 signature pattern required for ALL Lens network Lit Actions
- **Critical for**: Future development of any Lit Actions that write to Lens contracts
- **Includes**: Complete code examples, troubleshooting, and common mistakes to avoid

### 2. Unified Karaoke Grader Lit Action
- **File**: `src/karaoke/karaoke-grader-v5.js`
- **Purpose**: Next-generation unified karaoke grader combining best practices from existing actions
- **Features**:
  - PerformanceGrader contract integration (event-only, PKP-signed)
  - FSRS-4.5 spaced repetition algorithm
  - Voxstral STT integration
  - Test mode support
  - 16-field EIP-712 signature pattern for Lens
  - Pronunciation scoring with Levenshtein distance
  - Future-ready for leaderboard indexing

### 3. Updated Contract Configuration
- **File**: `src/karaoke/contracts.config.js`
- **Changes**:
  - Lens Testnet as primary network (Chain ID: 37111)
  - PerformanceGrader contract configuration (to be deployed)
  - Base Sepolia marked as legacy
  - Network-specific RPC endpoints
  - Proper contract address organization

### 4. Comprehensive Agents Documentation
- **File**: `AGENTS.md`
- **Purpose**: Complete overview of all Lit Actions in the architecture
- **Includes**:
  - Detailed inventory of all Lit Actions
  - Critical architecture patterns
  - Development workflow
  - Security considerations
  - Quick reference for common operations

### 5. Archive Cleanup
- **Action**: Moved outdated Lit Actions to archive directories
- **Files Archived**: audio-processor-v4.js, translate-lyrics-v1.js, base-alignment-v1/2.js, auto-purchase-credits.js, lyrics-alignment-v1.js, song-metadata-v1.js
- **Reason**: Cleaner codebase with focus on current production actions

## üîç Key Findings

### Current State
1. **Sophisticated Lit Actions Already Exist**: `study-scorer-v1.js` has complete FSRS-4.5 implementation
2. **Critical Pattern Identified**: `karaoke-scorer-v4.js` contains the essential 16-field signature pattern for Lens
3. **Contract Ready**: PerformanceGrader.sol is well-designed but not yet deployed to Lens
4. **Mixed Networks**: Some actions on Base Sepolia (legacy), others on Lens Testnet

### Critical Architecture
1. **Lens Network Requirements**: All contracts write to Lens Testnet (Chain ID: 37111) using zkSync EIP-712
2. **PKP Integration**: Hardcoded PKP credentials for trusted transaction signing
3. **Event-Only Contracts**: PerformanceGrader emits events for subgraph indexing (no storage)
4. **Complex Signatures**: 16-field pattern is non-negotiable for Lens transactions

## üöÄ Next Steps for Implementation

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Deploy PerformanceGrader Contract**
   ```bash
   cd contracts
   forge script script/DeployEvents.s.sol --rpc-url lens-testnet --broadcast
   ```

2. **Update Contract Addresses**
   - Update `PERFORMANCE_GRADER_ADDRESS` in `contracts.config.js` with deployed address
   - Update subgraphs to index `PerformanceGraded` events

3. **Test New Lit Action**
   ```bash
   # Test karaoke-grader-v5.js in test mode
   dotenvx run -- node src/test/test-karaoke-grader-v5.mjs
   ```

### Development Guidelines
1. **Always Use Signature Pattern**: Any new Lit Action for Lens MUST use the documented 16-field pattern
2. **Test Mode First**: Use test mode during development to avoid API costs
3. **PKP Permissions**: Ensure Lit Action IPFS CIDs are added to PKP permissions
4. **Event Emission**: Design contracts to emit events (not store data) for efficient subgraph indexing

## üìä Architecture Benefits

### PerformanceGrader Approach
- **Gas Efficient**: ~48k gas vs ~100k for storage-based contracts
- **Anti-Cheat**: Only trusted PKP can grade performances
- **Scalable**: Event-only contracts scale infinitely
- **Transparent**: All grading events are publicly verifiable

### FSRS Integration
- **Optimal Learning**: Spaced repetition algorithm for language learning
- **Offline Capable**: Algorithm runs in Lit Action without external dependencies
- **Proven Method**: FSRS-4.5 is scientifically validated for memory retention

### 16-Field Signature Pattern
- **Security**: EIP-712 provides stronger guarantees than simple keccak256
- **Consistency**: Standardized across all Lens transactions
- **Future-Proof**: Works with Lens mainnet and any zkSync-based networks

## üîí Security Model

### Multi-Layer Protection
1. **TEE Execution**: Lit Actions run in Trusted Execution Environments
2. **PKP Authorization**: Only trusted PKP addresses can sign sensitive transactions
3. **Event Immutability**: Blockchain events cannot be forged or modified
4. **Access Control**: API keys encrypted and only accessible within Lit Action

### Anti-Cheat Mechanisms
1. **PerformanceGrader**: Only PKP can call `gradePerformance()`
2. **Subgraph Verification**: All scores traceable to on-chain events
3. **Immutable Events**: No way to tamper with historical scores

## üìà Scalability Considerations

### Current Limits
- **Lit Action Execution**: ~30 seconds timeout
- **Voxstral API**: Rate limits on STT requests
- **Lens Gas Costs**: ~$0.001 per grading transaction

### Optimization Strategies
1. **Batch Processing**: Process multiple lines in single transaction
2. **Caching**: Store transcript results in Grove for reuse
3. **Progressive Scoring**: Real-time feedback during singing
4. **CDN Integration**: Grove provides fast content delivery
