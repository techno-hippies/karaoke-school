+## Archived PerformanceGrader Lit Actions

- `say-it-back-v1.js` and `say-it-back-v1-simple.js` implement the legacy flow
  that called `PerformanceGrader`.
- Tests and helper scripts referencing the old contract also live here.
- The production scorer is now `study/exercise-grader-v1.js`, which targets
  `ExerciseEvents`.

Keep these files for reference only—do not deploy them without reviving the
legacy contract.
