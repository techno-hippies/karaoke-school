# Creators Module (Future Implementation)

**TikTok dancers posting derivative performance videos**

## Overview

Creators are TikTok dancers who post performance videos dancing to artist songs. Unlike artists (who own original music), creators post derivative works with 18/82 Story Protocol revenue split.

## Flow

1. **Create Creator Profile**
   - Mint PKP (Lit Protocol)
   - Create Lens account
   - Register on blockchain (CreatorRegistry - future contract)

2. **Post Dance Video**
   - Upload TikTok dance video to Grove
   - Mint Story Protocol IP Asset (18/82 split)
   - Post to Lens as creator

3. **Revenue Model**
   - 18% to dancer (creator)
   - 82% to original rights holders (via MLC publishers)
