# Contract Refactoring Summary

## Renaming Complete ✅

### Contracts Renamed
1. **ArtistQuizTrackerV1** → **SongQuizV1**
   - More accurate: tracks quizzes per-song, not per-artist
   - Artist aggregation happens off-chain via events
   - Directory: `/contracts/SongQuiz/`

2. **StudyTrackerV1** → **StudyProgressV1**
   - More descriptive: tracks learning progress over time
   - "Tracker" was redundant
   - Directory: `/contracts/StudyProgress/`

3. **TrendingTrackerV1** → (unchanged)
   - "Tracker" appropriate here (tracks trending metrics)

### Architecture Updated
- All references updated in `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Contract interface updated: `IStudyTracker` → `IStudyProgress`
- Variable names updated: `studyTracker` → `studyProgress`
- Function parameters updated throughout

---

## Critical Fixes Implemented ✅

### 1. Time Limit: 8s → 15s
**Problem**: 8 seconds too tight with network overhead
**Solution**: 15 seconds total (~12-13s actual thinking time)
- Network overhead (PKP round trips): ~2-3 seconds
- Actual user time: Read question + 4 answers + think
- Still prevents: Genius lookup, ChatGPT, Google searches

**Changes**:
- `TIME_LIMIT_SECONDS = 15` in contract
- All docs/comments updated
- ARCHITECTURE.md updated with timing breakdown

---

### 2. PKP Can Register Songs
**Problem**: `registerSong()` was owner-only, but PKP needs to register Genius songs dynamically
**Solution**: Added `onlyOwnerOrQuizMaster` modifier

**Changes**:
```solidity
modifier onlyOwnerOrQuizMaster() {
    require(msg.sender == owner || msg.sender == trustedQuizMaster, "Not authorized");
    _;
}

function registerSong(...) external onlyOwnerOrQuizMaster { // Changed from onlyOwner
```

**Flow**:
- Owner registers native songs (from song-uploader)
- PKP registers Genius songs (when first question generated)

---

### 3. Question Management
**Problem**: No way to remove/fix bad questions
**Solution**: Added disable/enable/replace functions (owner-only)

**New Functions**:
```solidity
function disableQuestion(geniusId, questionIndex) external onlyOwner;
function enableQuestion(geniusId, questionIndex) external onlyOwner;
function replaceQuestion(geniusId, questionIndex, ciphertext, hash) external onlyOwner;
```

**Security**: PKP cannot disable questions (prevents malicious removal)

---

### 4. Sequential Unlock Fix
**Problem**: Disabled questions would break sequential unlock (user gets stuck)
**Solution**: Auto-skip disabled questions

**Changes**:
```solidity
// Before recording quiz:
uint32 expectedIndex = userProgress.nextQuestionIndex;
while (expectedIndex < questionIndex &&
       (!questions[geniusId][expectedIndex].exists ||
        !questions[geniusId][expectedIndex].enabled)) {
    expectedIndex++;
}

// After completing quiz:
uint32 nextIndex = questionIndex + 1;
while (nextIndex < questionCount[geniusId] &&
       questions[geniusId][nextIndex].exists &&
       !questions[geniusId][nextIndex].enabled) {
    nextIndex++;
}
```

---

### 5. Study Gating Integration
**Problem**: Contract stored `studyProgress` address but never called it
**Solution**: Added on-chain check in `recordQuizCompletion()`

**Changes**:
```solidity
// Before recording quiz result:
require(IStudyProgress(studyProgress).studiedToday(user), "Must study before quiz");
```

**Why On-Chain** (not in Lit Action):
- Can't be bypassed (PKP can't skip this check)
- Tamper-proof (StudyProgress contract is source of truth)
- Gas-efficient (single storage read)

---

### 6. Pagination for Artist Songs
**Problem**: `getArtistSongs()` returns full array - could be 200+ songs for big artists
**Solution**: Added paginated query function

**New Function**:
```solidity
function getArtistSongsPaginated(
    uint32 geniusArtistId,
    uint256 offset,
    uint256 limit
) external view returns (uint32[] memory songs, uint256 total);
```

**Usage**:
```typescript
// Get first 20 songs
const { songs, total } = await songQuiz.getArtistSongsPaginated(artistId, 0, 20);

// Get next 20
const { songs: moreSongs } = await songQuiz.getArtistSongsPaginated(artistId, 20, 20);
```

---

### 7. User Progress Reset
**Problem**: No way to reset user data (GDPR compliance / testing)
**Solution**: Added reset function (owner-only)

**New Function**:
```solidity
function resetUserProgress(uint32 geniusId, address user) external onlyOwner;
```

**Behavior**:
- Clears all progress (streaks, correct count, etc.)
- Keeps leaderboard entry (historical record)
- Emits event for audit trail

---

### 8. New Events
**Added**:
```solidity
event QuestionDisabled(geniusId, geniusArtistId, questionIndex, timestamp);
event QuestionEnabled(geniusId, geniusArtistId, questionIndex, timestamp);
event QuestionReplaced(geniusId, geniusArtistId, questionIndex, timestamp);
event UserProgressReset(geniusId, geniusArtistId, user, timestamp);
```

**Why**: The Graph can track question inventory changes + user data management

---

### 9. Struct Update
**Added `enabled` field to `EncryptedQuestion`**:
```solidity
struct EncryptedQuestion {
    string ciphertext;
    string dataToEncryptHash;
    bytes32 referentHash;
    uint64 addedAt;
    bool exists;
    bool enabled;  // NEW: for soft delete
}
```

---

## Anti-Cheat Architecture Documented

### Strong Bot Defense via Study Gating
**Why it works**:
1. Requires speaking lyrics (TTS for bots)
2. TTS costs: $0.10-1.00 per quiz
3. Creates behavioral data (timing, pauses, mistakes)
4. Economic barrier: costs > rewards

**Flow**:
```
1. User opens app
2. Must speak lyrics (SayItBack exercises) ← Bot barrier
3. StudyProgressV1 records session
4. studiedToday() returns true
5. User can now access quiz
6. Contract checks: require(IStudyProgress(studyProgress).studiedToday(user))
```

### Time Limit (15 seconds)
- Prevents: Genius lookup, ChatGPT, Google
- Allows: Reading + thinking
- Network overhead accounted for

### Daily Limit
- 1 quiz per song per day (on-chain enforcement)
- Can't grind same song repeatedly

### Encrypted Questions
- Can't precompute answers
- PKP only decrypts NEXT question

### Owner Control
- Can disable bad questions
- PKP cannot (security isolation)

---

## Contract Capabilities

### ✅ What It CAN Do:

1. **Enforce 1 quiz per song per day** (rock solid, on-chain)
2. **Validate 15-second time limit** (PKP-signed timestamps)
3. **Query top fans for artist** (direct queries or The Graph)
4. **Binary right/wrong scoring** (simple, fair)
5. **Track user performance over time** (per-song and per-artist stats)
6. **Auto-skip disabled questions** (seamless sequential unlock)
7. **Paginate artist songs** (handles 200+ songs gracefully)
8. **Reset user data** (GDPR compliance)

### ❌ What It CAN'T Do:

1. **Cryptographically enforce 15s** (relies on PKP-provided timestamps)
   - Mitigation: PKP is trusted signer, auditable code
2. **Prevent PKP from cheating** (PKP can mark wrong as correct)
   - Mitigation: PKP code auditable, runs on Lit Network
3. **Enforce question quality** (encrypted, can't validate)
   - Mitigation: Owner can disable/replace bad questions
4. **Native referent verification** (trusts PKP-provided hashes)
   - Mitigation: Events emit referentHash for off-chain audit

---

## TypeScript Types Updated

**File**: `/shared/types/index.ts`

**Changes**:
1. Added `enabled: boolean` to `EncryptedQuestion` interface
2. All contract names kept generic (types don't reference contract names)
3. Ready for frontend integration

---

## Files Modified

### Contracts
- ✅ `/contracts/SongQuiz/SongQuizV1.sol` (renamed + all fixes)
- ✅ `/contracts/SongQuiz/ARCHITECTURE.md` (complete rewrite)
- ✅ `/contracts/StudyProgress/StudyProgressV1.sol` (renamed, no other changes)

### Types
- ✅ `/shared/types/index.ts` (EncryptedQuestion.enabled added)
