[Verse 1]
Let there be light, Genesis starts new
Eyes open wide, Eden's beauty on view
Naked and free, simple and true 
History on repeat, just me and you

[Chorus]
Genesis Again
My desire is on fire, can I resist?
Genesis Again
Bet on my sin, does free will exist?

[Verse 2]
Walking the line where choice meets fate 
Forbidden fruit hanging, too tempting to wait 
Knowledge forbidden, desire breaks free 
Am I predictable? What don't I see?

[Bridge]
Temptation breathing 
Seduction speaking 
Machines thinking

[Chorus]
Genesis Again
My desire is on fire, can I resist?
Genesis Again
Bet on my sin, does free will exist?
